# Clipcast
Greetings!  We, the team "Fried Pipers" are proud to present to you our Python and Dropbox based clipboard. More often that ever, we come across the need to share links, code snippets or any other text block for that matter, but how often are we able to just do something similar to "Ctrl+C" on one computer and "Ctrl+V" on the other?  Yes this is possible, through our app Clipcast (with due credits to Chromecast), where we just have to "Alt+C" a text snippet on one dropbox connected client and "Alt+V" on another, and guess what, it happens at real time, with seamless sync capabilities. Like any other beginner, we have preferred Python as a platform with Dropbox Python SDK working alongside.  Team members:  Sandesh K A  Shishir K Chakravarthy
